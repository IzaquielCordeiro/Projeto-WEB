</p><p class="blox-docs-class-description">Utility directive to trigger window 'resize' events not only when the browser window
is resized, but also when the browser window gets a vertical scrollbar.
This solves problems with directives that base their layout or position on the
width of the document body. When a scrollbar is added, the body width changes, but the browser
doesn't fire a 'resize' (or other) event. As long as at least one <code>mdcScrollbarResize</code>
directive is active on the page, 'resize' events will also be fired when the body width changes
as a consequence of the addition or removal of a vertical toolbar.
The directive adds a hidden iframe to the page, that contains the trickery to make this happen.

github gist</a> for the original idea.</p><table class="blox-docs-properties-table">
