</p><p class="blox-docs-class-description">Directive for creating a Material Design checkbox. The checkbox is driven by an
underlying native checkbox input, which must use the <code>MdcCheckboxInputDirective</code>
directive.
The current implementation will add all other required DOM elements (such as the
background).
Future implementations will also support supplying (customized) background
elements.
</p><p>
This directive can be used together with an <code>mdcFormField</code> to
easily position checkboxes and their labels, see
<a href="#/directives/form-field">mdcFormField</a>.</p>
